    "Classification of images can also be performed using SVMs. Experimental results show that SVMs achieve significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback. This is also true of image segmentation systems, including those using a modified version SVM that uses the privileged approach as suggested by Vapnik.\n",

    "\n",
    "•\tWhat are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "There are four main advantages: First, it has a regularization parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding over-fitting. Second, it uses the kernel trick, so one can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel. Third, an SVM is defined by a convex optimization problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods (e.g. SMO). Last, it approximates a bound on the test error rate, and there is a substantial body of theory behind it which suggests it should be a good idea.\n",

    "•\tRequires full labeling of input data\n",
    "•\tUncalibrated class membership probabilities\n",
    "•\tThe SVM is only directly applicable for two-class tasks. Therefore, algorithms that reduce the multi-class task to several binary problems must be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tParameters of a solved model are difficult to interpret.\n",
    "Drawback of the SVMs, one must choose the kernel. That means you must provide the true structure of the data as an input, while other algorithms, like neural networks or random-forests, try to automatically find the structure. Also, you have to tune the parameters for the kernels and the C parameter which can be time consuming and decrease the performance if done wrong. Essentially, SVMs tend to run slower than other algorithms and perform poorly on highly skewed/imbalanced data sets. \n",

    "•\tWhat makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "The data has been processed into binary format with conversion of “yes” and “no” features to numeric values and dummy variables for categorical features. And the target variable is requisitely binary. The size of the feature space is not overly large in comparison to the sample space. And the data doesn’t exhibit skewness or imbalance.\n",

    "Adaboost\n",
    "•\tDescribe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.  \n",
    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a powerful classifier that works well on both basic and more complex recognition problems, such as biology, computer vision, and speech processing. [4] http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost \n",
    "\n",
    "What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "Evaluating every feature can reduce not only the speed of classifier training and execution, but in fact reduce predictive power, per the Hughes Effect. Unlike neural networks and SVMs, the AdaBoost training process selects only those features known to improve the predictive power of the model, reducing dimensionality and potentially improving execution time as irrelevant features do not need to be computed. [5] http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost  \n",
    "What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "Weak classifiers too weak can lead to low margins, and can also lead to overfitting. AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data, outliers and particularly uniform noise. [6] http://math.mit.edu/~rothvoss/18.304.3PM/Presentations/1-Eric-Boosting304FinalRpdf.pdf \n",
    "•\tWhat makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",

    "•\t What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "It’s robust: the independent variables don’t have to be normally distributed, or have equal variance. It does not assume a linear relationship between the features and target. Can handle skewness of data, and no assumption of homogeneity of variance assumption. Performs well in Bernoulli situations, i.e. Probability of passing an exam versus hours of study (similar to our data set.) [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhat are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "The advantages of logistic regression come at a cost: it requires much more data to achieve stable, meaningful results. For logistic regression, at least 50 data points per predictor is necessary to achieve stable results.

    "\n",

    "Ok, so after choosing and coding each of the algorithms and reaching my conclusions, I found the above noted weakness. The LogisticRegression (LR) model performed reasonable well in comparison to the other two, and I have used it in the past, but I would not choose it again. Strictly following our directions and what we learned in the videos and quizzes, I didn’t see any reason to not choose LR, but once I’d researched it, I see that it really isn’t a good candidate given the number of features and sample size. It may begin to do better as larger datasets are analyzed and it has good runtime even for big datasets. But, given the present situation and hindsight I wouldn’t choose it for this scenario.\n",

    "The Support Vector Machine (SVM) takes data about previous students (age, gender, family, etc), and uses them to create a function that draws a boundary between the students who passed and those who didn't. The boundary should be drawn so as to maximize the distance between students who passed and those that failed. This ‘maximum margin’ will give the most buffer for future students that may have slightly different characteristics, to be categorized correctly as students in need of intervention and those don’t or may only need to be monitored. For instance, note the graph below and let the red squares be students that failed and the blue circles be students that passed. The Optimal hyperplane is drawn to maximize the margin. The squares and circles correspond to students and the fully colored in squares and circle respectively are the vectors (points in 2D) that give SVM its name. If in the future a student is plotted closer than either of the squares or circle, the margin gives a better chance these students will be categorized appropriately. This way, the cost of intervention can be kept down when the charateristics are different, but still classified correctly. \n",

    "The final model had an F1 score for training of 0.8260 and for testing 0.8205. Both of these numbers are comparable to the untuned model. Which is a bit disconcerting that the model wasn't able to be tuned better. However, it may perform better with future data, which is the important aspect of this project. Of the 130 students who failed, having this model applied, early enough to their data would have resulted in identifying 106 students that needed help. If that help would then have produced a \"passed\" score for the target variable, then 371 students would have \"passed\" and the graduation rate would have been 93.9%. The school districts goal of a 95% graduation rate would be that much closer. With some other criteria, teacher observations for instance, the goal could be reasonably reached. "
